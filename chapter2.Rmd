# Studen datablablalsdlfnsd

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using  

For this exercise I will be using dataset on Student's learning data collected by Kimmo Vehkalahti. I use smaller part of the data... 

The data set looks like this:
```{r}
learning <- read.csv("data/learning.csv")
str(learning)
```
