# Logistic regression

## Data descpription

In this chapter I will do logistic regression exercises. Exercises are done with student alcohol consumption data set. 

First I combined two smaller data sets and removed duplicates from the combined data set. 

After combining the data set I created new combined columns to the data set. I counted average alcohol use from answers on *weekly* and *daily* alcohol consumption (`alc_use`). From that I created a variable `high_use` which is `TRUE` if the average `alc_use` is greater than 2. Data wrangling process in this [file](https://github.com/jokiilk/IODS-project/blob/master/data/create_alc.R)

The combined data set looks like this:

```{r}
alc <- read.table("data/alc.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
alc$X <- NULL
```
```{r}
head(alc)
str(alc)
summary(alc)
```
